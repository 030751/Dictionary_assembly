# Dictionary_assembly

The main idea behind creating a dictionary is to create such a word bank that contains enough words to 
provide the user the ease to get the meaning of any word, anytime. The dictionary that we have created is a 
console-based dictionary. It is a dictionary that contains 500+ 5-letter words at the moment. It’s all coded in MASM, assembly language. 


# FUNCTIONALITY: 
The functionality that the dictionary provides contains:

• Searching the meaning of entered word

 Correctly spelled word
 
 Misspelled word
 
• Addition of a word in Dictionary

• Deletion of a word from Dictionary
